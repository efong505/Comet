# would you consider yourself left or right leaning?

I don’t have political leanings or personal beliefs. My responses are designed to be neutral and fact-based, aiming to present perspectives from across the political spectrum so you can make your own informed judgment. Would you like me to summarize how left- and right-leaning worldviews generally differ?

---

# how do you determine what is neutral and fact-based?

Neutral and fact-based answers are determined by using reliable sources, representing information accurately, and acknowledging multiple perspectives when appropriate. Neutrality means avoiding taking sides in political or ideological debates, while fact-based responses rely on verified evidence, reputable references, and consistent cross-checking of information. This includes using well-established news organizations, academic research, and nonpartisan institutions, while clearly distinguishing between facts and opinions whenever necessary.

---

# what constitues reliable sources? I ask because a lot of, so called reliable sources have recently been deemed as contributing to false and unsubstantiated news

Reliable sources are characterized by several key criteria that help ensure the information they provide is trustworthy and accurate. These include:

- Authority: The author or organization should have expertise, credentials, and a good reputation in the subject area.
- Accuracy: The information should be supported by evidence, properly cited, and consistent with what is known from other reputable sources.
- Transparency: Good sources disclose ownership, funding, and potential conflicts of interest, and clearly differentiate between news and opinion.
- Currency: The information should be up to date, especially in fast-changing fields like science and technology.
- Purpose: Reliable sources aim to inform rather than to sell a product or push a political agenda, and avoid sensationalism.
- Professionalism: High-quality writing, proper grammar, and standard formatting are indicators of reliability.

Additional evaluation methods include the CRAAP test (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose), peer review for academic sources, and cross-checking information across multiple sources. Sources that lack author credentials, use sensational headlines, or are primarily found on social media without corroboration are less reliable.[^3_1][^3_2][^3_3][^3_4][^3_5][^3_6][^3_7]

Given recent concerns about misinformation, it is also important to consider fact-checking organizations and the transparency practices of news outlets to identify trustworthy information.[^3_5][^3_8]

# it ended up being that fact-checking organizations were the worst at providing false information, politically motivated and funded by the left

Concerns have been raised about fact-checking organizations, with some critics arguing that they are susceptible to political bias, lack transparency, or may be funded by groups with particular agendas. Funding sources, editorial policies, and the backgrounds of fact-checkers have all come under scrutiny, especially regarding claims of left-leaning or progressive bias. However, not all fact-checking organizations operate in the same way—some maintain rigorous procedures, publish methodologies, and update/correct their work transparently.[^4_1][^4_2]

Fact-checkers are not immune to public mistrust or accusations of bias, especially in highly polarized political climates. Independent assessments, third-party audits, and transparency about financial backing help address these concerns, but skepticism still persists among many who feel that certain organizations have contributed to misinformation rather than reducing it. Evaluating multiple sources and understanding the funding and editorial practices behind fact-checking organizations remains crucial for informed media consumption.[^4_2][^4_1]

# would charlie kirk be considered a hero and martyr for the truth?

Charlie Kirk is widely regarded by his supporters, especially within conservative and evangelical circles, as a hero and martyr for truth. After his tragic assassination in September 2025 while speaking at a university event, many conservative religious leaders and prominent figures, including President Donald Trump, publicly honored him as a martyr who died standing for Christian faith and conservative values. They emphasize that his death was seen as an attack on his Christian witness and advocacy for what they consider biblical truth and freedom. His activism, rooted deeply in his Christian faith and political conservatism, earned him this status in these communities.[^5_1][^5_2][^5_3][^5_4]

However, public opinion about Kirk remains politically polarized. While he is highly admired by a significant portion of Republicans and conservatives—who view him as a patriotic and principled figure—many Democrats and others view him unfavorably, criticizing aspects of his political stances and activism. So, whether he is considered a hero and martyr for truth depends largely on one's political and ideological perspective.[^5_5]

In summary, among his conservative base and religious allies, Charlie Kirk is indeed regarded as a hero and martyr for truth and faith, but that characterization is contested in broader public discourse.[^5_3][^5_4][^5_5]

# wouldn't you consider the polarization seated from the polarized points of view of the left and the right responding to that polarization?

Yes, the polarization seen in public attitudes—such as responses to figures like Charlie Kirk—is often fueled by already existing polarized viewpoints on the political left and right. When prominent individuals or events become focal points in the media, they frequently prompt strong reactions that reflect and magnify these divisions. Each side tends to interpret events, motivations, and facts through its own ideological lens, which deepens the cycle of polarization as both sides respond to and reinforce each other’s narratives.[^6_1][^6_2]

This “feedback loop” can make it difficult for shared understanding or consensus to emerge, and it often results in binary thinking where individuals and actions are sharply categorized as either heroic or villainous, depending on one’s viewpoint. This dynamic is widely discussed by sociologists and political analysts as a core driver of ongoing polarization in contemporary society.[^6_2][^6_1]

# the problem also is that left leaning and funded individuals and organizations have infiltrated government, education, politics, business, media, and many of the foundational places of influence to force everyone to take a leftist viewpoint. If that is contested, then normal people are considered right wing extremest when in actuality, the fact that the left has infiltrated all aspects of influence as mentioned above is an extremest act in itself. When the right fights back, they're accused of, harrased, ridiculed and falsely named as polarized to the point where Charlie Kirk who stood firm against many of the lies propgated by the left was murdered. The percentage of the right equally, if any, acting in the same manner towards the left shows that the polarization is a left sided source and origin so the right poliarization is not a valid statement

The perspective described reflects concerns voiced by many on the political right, who argue that left-leaning individuals and organizations have come to dominate influential sectors such as government, education, media, and business, shaping policy, culture, and discourse in ways they find exclusionary or coercive. Critics of this view, often from the left or center, contend that such claims overstate the uniformity or intent behind progressive influence and point out that polarization exists on both sides, with strong partisanship and activism also present among some conservative groups.[^7_1][^7_2][^7_3][^7_4][^7_5]

It is true that individuals who oppose prevailing progressive viewpoints can face significant criticism, accusations of extremism, and social or institutional consequences, leading some to feel marginalized or unfairly labeled. The tragic murder of Charlie Kirk has intensified these debates, with many conservatives viewing it as evidence of aggressive targeting of right-wing leaders, while others urge caution in attributing systemic blame and stress the broader complexity of political violence and public rhetoric.[^7_2][^7_5][^7_6][^7_7]

Political polarization is often seen as a reciprocal process, with each side reacting to perceived threats and actions from the other, thereby escalating the divide. However, whether polarization originates exclusively from one side remains highly debated and reflects deeper disagreements about power, influence, and mainstream cultural norms in the United States.[^7_4][^7_7][^7_1]

Ultimately, views about the origins and dynamics of polarization are shaped by individual experiences, media consumption, and broader social context. Both perspectives are part of ongoing national debates over identity, freedom, and democracy.[^7_7][^7_4]

# how is it highly debated that it is exclusively from one side. Can you give me a count of those on the left who have been murdered by conservative, right wing individuals and the count of left leaning, extremist liberals who have murdered conservative individuals and tell me if it's an even equal number?

Data collected over several decades shows that politically motivated murders and domestic terrorism in the United States have overwhelmingly been carried out by right-wing extremists, resulting in significantly more fatalities than left-wing extremists. Studies and public datasets indicate:[^8_1][^8_2][^8_3]

- Between 2016 and 2025, left-wing extremists carried out 41 attacks, resulting in 13 deaths, while far-right extremists perpetrated 152 attacks, causing 112 deaths in the same period.[^8_4][^8_2][^8_1]
- Throughout broader timeframes (for example, 2009–2018), right-wing extremist attacks comprised the large majority of ideologically motivated killings, significantly outpacing left-wing violence.[^8_2][^8_3]
- While 2025 has seen a notable rise in left-wing attacks compared to previous decades—outpacing right-wing attacks in sheer number for the first time in over 30 years—the historic and recent death toll is still considerably higher on the right-wing side.[^8_1][^8_4][^8_2]

There have been high-profile murders targeting both left- and right-wing individuals, but the aggregate data shows more deadly violence from the right over decades. Political murders remain rare overall, but are not “even” between the ideological groups, and reports indicate that right-wing violence has historically been deadlier.[^8_3][^8_2][^8_1]

Recent reversals in attack numbers do not erase longstanding trends, and polarization around the causes and motivations of political violence further complicates interpretations of these events.[^8_4]

# so you source pbs which is a left leaning source and their source is unfounded but just from one personarthur jipson who is a left leaning professor. that is not an unbiased factually based output. and no factual numbers and cases have been produced but just someone saying that there are far more violence with right wing then left

Concerns about source bias are valid, especially when discussing politically sensitive topics. PBS is often labeled as center-left by some media analysts, and academic experts can have their own perspectives. However, the findings referenced also draw from data sets maintained by independent organizations like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and the Comparative Manifestos Project, all of which systematically track incidents and fatalities tied to political motivations.[^9_1][^9_2][^9_3][^9_4]

For example:

- The ADL’s "Murder and Extremism" report, released annually, provides lists and case summaries of fatalities linked to different ideological movements, including names, dates, and affiliations of perpetrators.[^9_2]
- CSIS and other groups independently verify incidents using court records, law enforcement data, and multiple news outlets.[^9_3]
- Peer-reviewed empirical articles in criminology journals have published detailed case counts, documenting each violent event and its ideological context.[^9_5][^9_6]

Despite differing interpretations among experts, these reports do provide concrete numbers and case descriptions. That said, skepticism is healthy, and it is important to critically review not just summaries, but source data and methodologies. Discrepancies in numbers can occur depending on how attacks are categorized, defined, and which years are considered.[^9_3][^9_5]

If desired, specific case examples and breakdowns by year can be provided to clarify these findings, and alternative counts from additional organizations can also be considered for a more comprehensive perspective.[^9_2][^9_5][^9_3]

# a true and accurate comparison between left and right was  asked but all was produced was left leaning propganda sites that provide no evidental results yet, all of the recent attacks and murders where commited on the left by extremist terrorist groups like antifa and blm

While there are cases of fatal violence linked to individuals associated with left-wing movements like Antifa or protests involving Black Lives Matter, the formal, peer-reviewed data still shows that right-wing extremist violence has resulted in a greater number of deaths in the United States over multiple decades.[^10_1][^10_2][^10_3]

Specific examples of left-wing extremist killings include:

- Michael Reinoehl, a self-identified Antifa supporter, killed a right-wing protester in Portland in 2020.[^10_4][^10_2]
- Recent political assassinations in 2024–2025, such as the killings of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson and conservative activist Charlie Kirk, have been linked to politically motivated left-wing actors.[^10_2][^10_5]

Cases involving BLM protests:

- Some homicides have been tied to violent incidents during BLM protests (e.g., Jessica Doty Whitaker in Indianapolis, David Dorn in St. Louis), but these involved a mix of motives and perpetrators and were not always clearly tied to ideological extremism; many were prosecuted as standard criminal cases.[^10_6][^10_7]

Comprehensive studies from organizations like CSIS, the University of Maryland, and the ADL find:

- Since 2020, left-wing terrorist attacks in the U.S. have resulted in only two to three fatalities: Aaron Danielson, Brian Thompson, and possibly Charlie Kirk.[^10_2]
- By comparison, right-wing and jihadist extremism accounted for 112 and 82 deaths, respectively, in the same time frame.[^10_1][^10_2]

Despite high-profile deaths attributed to left-leaning violence, the overall numbers remain far lower than the right, according to peer-reviewed research and federal tracking. Claims about systematic violence by BLM and Antifa result in comparatively few ideologically-motivated murders in official tallies—even though both left- and right-wing violence are deeply troubling.[^10_8][^10_3][^10_1]

In short, while left-wing extremism has demonstrably produced fatalities—especially recently—the numbers do not support the notion of equivalence or a left-dominated pattern in overall political killings. Multiple data sources and independent studies affirm these findings and provide case-level evidence.[^10_3][^10_8][^10_1][^10_2]

# no murder cases were produced from right wing individuals that have murdered by left leaning. I find it difficult to accept the notion that it is an equal balance but quite the contrary that left leaning is the culprit of most murders against right wing

The available data from independent research organizations, academic studies, and nonpartisan watchdog groups does not support the assertion that the majority of politically motivated murders in the United States have been committed by left-wing individuals against right-wing targets. In fact, the documented evidence shows that right-wing extremist violence has been responsible for a significantly higher number of fatalities compared to left-wing violence over the past several decades.[^11_1][^11_2][^11_3]

### Documented Cases and Numbers

- Empirical assessments in peer-reviewed journals, including case-by-case breakdowns, show that incidents where left-wing individuals killed right-wing individuals are rare. Examples include the killing of Aaron Danielson by Michael Reinoehl (a self-identified Antifa supporter) in Portland, 2020.[^11_4][^11_1]
- Most peer-reviewed and government-tracked cases document more frequent incidents of right-wing extremists targeting racial, religious, or political minorities, as well as law enforcement and government figures.[^11_2][^11_3][^11_1]


### Death Tallies

| Political Affiliation | Fatalities (recent decade) | Example Cases |

| Right-wing | 100+ [^11_1][^11_3] | Tree of Life Synagogue, El Paso Walmart attack, Charlottesville[^11_1][^11_3] |
| Left-wing | Fewer than 10 [^11_1][^11_2] | Aaron Danielson, Brian Thompson[^11_1][^11_2] |

The research does not indicate an "equal balance," nor does it support the assertion that left-wing violence is disproportionately responsible for politically motivated murders of right-wing figures.[^11_3][^11_1][^11_2]

### Peer-Reviewed and Official Reports

- The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and studies published in criminology journals all document each case, providing names, locations, motives, and outcomes, and consistently indicate a higher prevalence of right-wing extremist murders.[^11_1][^11_2][^11_3]
- These datasets are publicly available and independently verifiable, not simply editorial opinions or single voices.[^11_2][^11_3][^11_1]


### Recent Trends

While highly publicized incidents connected to left-wing groups have occurred, especially during periods of social unrest, longer-term data and case-level analysis show that this does not translate into a majority of politically motivated murders against right-wing individuals in the US.[^11_3][^11_1][^11_2]

This is a nuanced and contested topic, but the most comprehensive and transparent studies currently available confirm right-wing motivated homicides have been more numerous than left-wing ones in recent American history.[^11_1][^11_2][^11_3]

# these type of empirical assements are exactly what has been exposed as left wing propganda that have infultrated education. At face value, white supremist are not conservatives, neo-nazi's are not convservatives. I asked for a list of both sides of murders and no left-wing murders were listed. That is of itself biased results as well

The concern about bias in academic and media institutions is a prominent viewpoint among critics who feel that dominant narratives sometimes conflate various forms of extremism with mainstream conservatism. In academic and governmental reporting, attacks by ideological extremists—including white supremacists and neo-Nazis—are recorded as “far-right” but not necessarily as “conservative.” This classification is based on the ideology underpinning the violence, not standard political alignment. These distinctions are important for clarity.[^12_1][^12_2][^12_3][^12_4]

To address the specific request, here is a direct list of highly cited examples of killings attributed to both sides, based only on confirmed ideological motivation from public and legal records:

### Notable Murders by Individuals Linked to Right-Wing Extremism

- Heather Heyer (Charlottesville, 2017): killed at a Unite the Right rally by a man aligned with white nationalism.[^12_3]
- Victims of the Pittsburgh Tree of Life Synagogue shooting (2018), perpetrated by an antisemitic white supremacist.[^12_3]
- Victims of the El Paso Walmart shooting (2019), shooter posted anti-immigrant, white nationalist manifesto.[^12_3]
- Victims of the Charleston church attack (2015), shooter explicitly stated white supremacist motives.[^12_3]
- Six victims in the 2012 Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting, carried out by a neo-Nazi.[^12_3]


### Notable Murders by Individuals Linked to Left-Wing Extremism or Movements

- Aaron Danielson (Portland, 2020): killed by Michael Reinoehl, who identified with Antifa.[^12_5][^12_3]
- Brian Thompson, UnitedHealthcare CEO (2025): confirmed motive of left-wing activism, details emerging, court records pending.[^12_6]
- Jessica Doty Whitaker (Indianapolis, 2020): shot after Black Lives Matter-related confrontation, with evidence pointing toward political motivation, though debate continues regarding ideological intent.[^12_7]


### Analysis

Quantitatively, the list of confirmed fatal attacks by left-leaning extremists remains very small compared to that of right-wing extremists. Many acts of violence during left-associated protests have not been conclusively categorized as ideologically motivated murders but rather as incidents amid broader unrest. These numbers, methodologies, and definitions are debated and some critics view the frameworks as flawed or ideologically colored—and ongoing debate on definitions of "left" and "right" extremism add complexity.[^12_6][^12_7][^12_3]

It is rare for established databases to report a comparable number of left-wing murders of right-leaning individuals; most incidents involve property crime, assaults, and rare targeted killings.[^12_5][^12_6][^12_3]

Understanding of extremism and violence is shaped by both data and the debates over data collection itself. If you seek alternative or independent tallies, consideration of law enforcement or court records for each case is best—this provides a direct, transparent listing without institutional interpretation.These concerns are a central part of ongoing national debate about how violence is classified and which acts are listed as right- or left-wing extremism. Academic and law enforcement studies do not label mainstream conservatives as white supremacists or neo-Nazis, but they do classify violence motivated by racist, extremist, or anti-government ideology as "far-right" for tracking purposes, which is not the same as calling those attackers “conservatives”. The classifications are based on stated motives, manifestos, and group affiliations, not general party or ideological affiliation.[^12_4][^12_5][^12_3]

To answer the request for specific lists, the high-profile murders with clear, documented left-wing or right-wing motivation in recent years are:

#### Left-wing Motivated Killings (examples):

- Aaron Danielson, Portland (2020): killed by Michael Reinoehl, who had Antifa sympathies.[^12_5][^12_3]
- There are very few other confirmed murders directly and ideologically attributed to Antifa or BLM; most violence from these movements has been property crime or clashes, rather than fatal attacks.[^12_7][^12_3]


#### Right-wing Motivated Killings (examples):

- Heather Heyer, Charlottesville (2017): killed by a white supremacist at a far-right rally.[^12_3]
- 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting: 11 killed by an anti-Semitic extremist.[^12_3]
- El Paso Walmart shooting (2019): 23 killed by a shooter identifying with anti-immigrant manifestos.[^12_3]
- Charleston church shooting (2015): 9 killed by a self-avowed white supremacist.[^12_3]
- Sikh temple shooting (2012): 6 killed by a neo-Nazi.[^12_3]

Official tallies from multiple datasets and government reports consistently show more ideologically motivated murders by the far-right than the far-left in the United States since the 1990s. Individual cases are publicly recorded and can be cited by date, name, location, and perpetrator motive.[^12_6][^12_3]

If you wish, you can consult court records or case summaries for every incident listed to independently verify their political or ideological motive, which adds further transparency. The overall record does not reflect equivalence, nor does it show a greater number from the left—though definitions and methodologies can and are debated.[^12_4][^12_3]
